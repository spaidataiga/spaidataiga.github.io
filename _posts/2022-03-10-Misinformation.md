We study how citizens engage with misinformation on Twitter in Denmark during the COVID-19
pandemic. We find that misinformation regarding facemasks is not corrected through counterarguments or fact-checking. Instead, many tweets rejecting misinformation use humor to mock
misinformation spreaders, whom they pejoratively label wearers of “tinfoil hats.” Tweets
rejecting misinformation project a superior social position and leave the concerns of
misinformation spreaders unaddressed. Our [study](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/johansen_tinfoil_hats_covid_19_twitter_20220302.pdf) highlights the role of status in people’s
engagement with online misinformation.
