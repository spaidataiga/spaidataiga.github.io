We study how citizens engage with misinformation on Twitter in Denmark during the COVID-19
pandemic. We find that misinformation regarding facemasks is not corrected through counterarguments or fact-checking. Instead, many tweets rejecting misinformation use humor to mock
misinformation spreaders, whom they pejoratively label wearers of “tinfoil hats.” Tweets
rejecting misinformation project a superior social position and leave the concerns of
misinformation spreaders unaddressed. Our [study](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/ridiculing-the-tinfoil-hats-citizen-responses-to-covid-19-misinformation-in-the-danish-facemask-debate-on-twitter/) highlights the role of status in people’s
engagement with online misinformation.
